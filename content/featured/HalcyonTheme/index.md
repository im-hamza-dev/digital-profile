improving, optimizing monitoring system for cctv network around port terminals, no intelligent platform to reduce cost of manual monitoring
we have to provide a platform to detect violations and show on our platform with proper statistics based on location and cameras
we created a tool to add camera, violation zones, and other required items on canvas, these items linked with ai-module, which detects critical usecase occuring inside those violation zones and generate alerts and provide information of violated usecase and frame to show on frontend app
these violations will be stored and can be preview later on from dashboard
statistics graph,
Health metrics of cameras,
heatmaps for data visualizations
