Developed an MVP web app for nutritionists to collect user details through a 15-question interactive form with a modern UI. Implemented data visualization and calorie deficit calculations to help users achieve weight gain or loss goals. The app generates a detailed PDF report with personalized metrics and diet plans, which is automatically emailed to the user.
