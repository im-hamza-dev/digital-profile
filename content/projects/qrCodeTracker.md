Built an MVP web app to generate QR codes from text and links, with a backend powered by Node.js and Express. Implemented a QR code listing page that fetches stored codes from an SQL database. Integrated a tracking system to log user and device details when a QR code is scanned, enabling real-time scan analytics.
